# COVID-19-Detection-Python-1-

You can find the .py scripts for implementing the networks mentioned in the paper "Covid-19: automatic detection from X-ray images utilizing transfer learning with convolutional neural networks" (doi: 10.1007/s13246-020-00865-4). Code lines with # refers to comments and are not meant to be executed, but you may alter them to evaluate different parameters. 

The datasets used in the experiments are open-access datasets and their publishers are mentioned in the References of the Paper.  Please note that some parameters (e.g. epochs, batch_size, trainable layers etc) may not be set to the exact same parameters mentioned in the paper, due to the fact that they may reflect the parameters used in some of the experiments, but not the optimal. You may need to tune them to obtain the results.Â To tune them, please read the paper and ensure the parameters of the paper and the parameters of the scripts agree.
